Problem: if you encounter Log in error with registered users:

    Cause: 
        Hashing needed 60 characters

    Solution:
        Change users table's password to VARCHAR 60 in the database so hashing works.


To Edit:
     #Users
        Please remove user ID input field from Add user modal in Users page.

    #Agents
        Please remove agent ID input field from Add Agent modal in Agents page.

     #Cards
        Please let the user input and edit cards with a single modal
            field should be: CardID , Bank(Dropdown), Cardtype(Dropdown), Amount, Status

    #Commissions
        Please remove 'Commission ID' input field from Manage Commission modal in Commissions page.

        Please remove 'Total Commission' input field from Manage Commission modal. This should be automated when they press submit.
            field should be: Username(Admin name or creator) , Agent name , Client name , Bank, Cardtype, quantity
                note: Data rendered will be with the Commission ID and Total Commission.(but not in user input).
                
Suggestions:

    #Commission
        Make agents and users(Creator) input field a dropdown to remove confusion when passing agentid to functions.

    #Settings
        create bank and cardtype in settings tab for owner access only for creation of cardtype and banks 
        create clear dissapproved in settings tab for owner access only




Questions:

    Is Total Commission User input? shoudn't it be automated ? 
    Where does the show all button from dashboard lead to?
    would there be any circumstance that we would delete a commission request ?
