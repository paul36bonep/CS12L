Problem: if you encounter Log in error with registered users:

    Cause: 
        Hashing needed 60 characters

    Solution:
        Change users table's password to VARCHAR 60 in the database so hashing works.

Problem: if you encounter database error with register user:

    Cause: Unit Manager is not defined in the database
    Solution: INSERT INTO `positions`(`PositionID`, `PositionName`) VALUES (3,'Unit Manager')
